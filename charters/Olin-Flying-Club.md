# Olin Flying Club
*Last modified 2016-09-27*

##Purpose
Olin has an abundance of people who like  aircraft, and a few who fly them. The Olin Flying Club aims to spread the
love of flying, and to make it more accessible to those who fly, are learning to fly, or want to fly.

##Membership
We welcome anyone to join Olin Flying Club. We welcome Pilots (both licensed and in training) to profit from shared resources,
and for those who are interested in learning, or who just want to share the love of flying to join us to learn from the pilots.

##Officers and Roles
President: During the startup period, one officer will be appointed (henceforth known as "Pilot In Command"),
The PIC will organise club activities and delegate responsibilities as they see fit. Other ranks may be created moving 
forwards under the discretion of the PIC.

##Transition Protocol
The PIC will not act alone during their last semester at Olin, or in the semester before an LOA/study abroad. An SIC (Second in Command) must assist the PIC to ensure that the knowledge of the PIC is not lost, and the PIC seat not be left empty when they retire.

##Club materials, Purchases, and Space
The Olin Flying Club will keep a library of literature relevant to pilots, as well as some equipment that can be borrowed. Funding will come from the existing club fund, as well as the personal libraries of the club's pilots, and donations from flight schools.

Olin College and any entity that reports to it will not pay for flights, these fall outside the scope of the club's activities.

##Events and Activities
The Olin Flying Club will serve as a social club in which members meet to share knowledge, stories, and experiences. The Olin Flying Club will not host any flying events, nor will these receive any funding through the Olin Flying Club. Any members who fly do so while exercising their rights as pilot's, and in no way represent the Olin Flying Club.

##Ammendment Procedure
The charter can be changed at any time following a 50% vote of active members.
