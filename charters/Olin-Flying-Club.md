# Olin Flying Club
*Last modified 2016-08-31*

##Purpose
Olin has an abundance of people who like to aircraft, and a few who fly them. The Olin Flying Club aims to spread the
love of flying, and to make it more accessible to those who fly, are learning to fly, or want to fly.

##Membership
We welcome anyone to join Olin Flying Club. We welcome Pilots (both licensed and in training) to profit from shared resources,
and for those who are interested in learning, or who just want to fly to join us as passengers.

##Officers and Roles
President: During the startup period, one officer will be appointed (henceforth known as "Pilot In Command"),
The PIC will organise club activities and delegate responsibilities as they see fit. Other ranks may be created moving 
forwards under the discretion of the PIC.

##Transition Protocol
The PIC will not act alone during their last semester at Olin. An SIC (Second in Command) must assist the PIC to ensure that
the knowledge of the PIC is not lost, and the PIC seat not left empty when they retire.

##Club materials, Purchases, and Space
The Olin Flying Club will keep a library of literature relevant to pilots, as well as some equipment that
passengers can borrow on flights. 
Funding will come from the existing club fund, as well as the personal libraries of the club's pilots, and donations from
flight schools.

##Events and Activities
Olin Flying Club will host flights with the licensed Pilots in which non-pilots would be invited to come for the flights.
Events like flyins involving multiple pilots would also be feasible. Outside of flying, pilots will be invited to share 
their knowledge and experience with each other, and and those members interested in learning to fly.

##Ammendment Procedure
The charter can be changed at any time following a 50% vote of active members.
